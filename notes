User: I created keys in my local and   i copied public to aws instance and private to github secrets
how it is working?
why it requires my local machines keyss??

GitHub Copilot: Optimizing tool selection...I'll examine your GitHub Actions workflow to explain how the SSH key setup works. 

Read [](file:///Users/hariomkumar/Downloads/Projects/node-app-deploy-githu-actions/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)

Here's how your SSH key setup works:

## How It Works

**The SSH Authentication Flow:**

1. **GitHub Actions runner** (Ubuntu instance) needs to connect to your **AWS instance** via SSH
2. When connecting, GitHub Actions provides your **private key** (from `secrets.SSH_KEY`)
3. The private key signs the connection attempt
4. Your AWS instance verifies this signature using the **public key** you added there
5. If they match → authentication successful → deployment proceeds

## Why Your Local Machine's Keys Are Used

You generated the key pair on your local machine, but **you're not using your local machine to deploy**. Instead:

- Your local machine was just the **generation point** for the keys
- Your **private key** (secret) goes to GitHub so the GitHub Actions runner can use it
- Your **public key** goes to AWS to recognize connections signed by that private key

Think of it like a lock & key system:
- 🔓 **Public key on AWS** = the lock
- 🔑 **Private key in GitHub Secrets** = the key
- When GitHub Actions runs, it uses the key to open the lock on your AWS instance

This is actually **more secure** than using your local machine's keys because:
- Your private key never needs to leave GitHub (or the GitHub Actions runner's temporary environment)
- You can revoke these specific keys anytime without affecting your local access
- It's isolated to just this deployment workflow

Does this clarify the flow? Would you like me to explain any other part of the deployment setup?
